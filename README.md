# Complex-calculator-using-neural-networks
This project implements a complex number calculator using neural networks. It allows users to perform various arithmetic operations on complex numbers using a neural network model.

## Features
- Addition
- subtraction 
- multiplication
- division of complex numbers

`main.py` also geneates a dataset that is kept with the name "dataset.csv" for future reference.
